# P5_sketches 🌈

This is a library of *sketches* made using the P5.js library. Each sketch has a live demo that can be viewed [**Here**](https://fishertom.github.io/P5_sketches/). 
I created these while learning Javascript and as such the code varies in quality. 

## Sketch Descriptions
A short description of how each sketch works
### Gravity

### Flock

### Circle of Circles

### Recursion 🌳
This sketch uses a recursive function to draw a generative tree. Every time the function is called it draws two branches starting from the end of the previous branch. A controlled amount of randomization in the branch length and angle means a unique tree is generated each time it is run. Modifying the *length, angle and randomization* can drasticly affect how the tree looks.
