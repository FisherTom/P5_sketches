# P5_sketches ðŸŒˆ

This is a library of _sketches_ made using the P5.js library. Each sketch has a live demo that can be viewed [**Here**](https://fishertom.github.io/P5_sketches/).

## Sketch Descriptions

A short description of how each sketch works

### Gravity

Using OOP and the P5 vector library, objects are magneticaly drawn to the center of gravity.

### Flock

Similar principal to Gravityâ¬† but with objects drawn towards the mouse

### Circle of Circles

2.5D Perlin noise doughnut

### Rotating Points

Plotting lines with trig functions.

### Recursion ðŸŒ³

This sketch uses a recursive function to draw a generative tree. Every time the function is called it draws two branches starting from the end of the previous branch. A controlled amount of randomization in the branch length and angle means a unique tree is generated each time it is run.
